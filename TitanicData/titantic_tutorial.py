# The first thing to do is to import the relevant packages
# that I will need for my script, 
# these include the Numpy (for maths and arrays)
# and csv for reading and writing csv files
# If i want to use something from this I need to call 
# csv.[function] or np.[function] first

import csv as csv 
import numpy as np

# Open up the csv file in to a Python object
csv_file_object = csv.reader(open('csv/train.csv', 'rb')) 
header = csv_file_object.next()  # The next() command just skips the 
                                 # first line which is a header
data=[]                          # Create a variable called 'data'.
for row in csv_file_object:      # Run through each row in the csv file,
    data.append(row)             # adding each row to the data variable
data = np.array(data) 	         # Then convert from a list to an array
